title: "My Journey with Java Spring Boot and my Warcraft ToDoList"
---

### About myself
Hello and welcome to my personal blog and first post! My name is Martin Bollin, and I am 31 years old. In this blog, I would like to share my experiences with Java Spring Boot with you. But that's not all - you will also get to know about my achievements, failures, and my past sprint reviews that I had with my mentor from [everyone codes](https://everyonecodes.io/).

### My Project "Warcraft ToDoList with API Integration"
I initially set out to create a ToDoList, but that seemed a bit too basic for me. I was eager to work with an API as learning becomes more effective through hands-on experience. Therefore, I made the decision to develop a ToDoList specifically for Warcraft Classic. In essence, the project involves retrieving my characters through the Blizzard API. Using the API, character details will be stored in the database, and each character will have an attached individual ToDoList with CRUD features, linked via a onetomany annotation. Sounds simple right? Little spoiler.. it wasn't.

Stay tuned for more!
